# Addiction duel

Addiction duel is a chrome extension that helps fight social media addiction through interaction with friends.

The app allows user to set up challenges between friends, during which sites specified by the user are blacklisted. The plugin tracks user activity on blacklisted sites and keeps all participants informed of each other's progress. The app gives you an opportunity to take part in many challenges at the same time and track history of all events. 

The main idea is to rely on close relationships, which significantly simplifies the overcoming social media addiction.
